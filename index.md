# CSC1023 Testing & Debugging
These are are CSC1023 Practical worksheets around Testing and Debugging. These practicals **are not assessed** but Testing and Debugging are becoming increasingly valuable skills in Software Engineering. Testing and Debugging can be a [dedicated job](https://www.cwjobs.co.uk/jobs/software-testing) in its own right, and large suites of complex tools can make the process seem abstract. In actuality, however, you've probably been doing informal Testing and Debugging work throughout Semester 1 already (or at least we hope so). These exercises are designed to show you how to pragmatically engage Testing and Debugging to not only develop your skills here, but to make your overall workflow easier when it comes to the rest of your programming.
